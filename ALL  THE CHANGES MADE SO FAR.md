1. Made the chatbot
   
2. Prevented errors from interrupting the program and handled it using exception handling. When the prompt is inappropriate, the bot throws a random reply from the 
   list "error_responses",
   and asks the user to talk abouit something else. The list "error_responses" is also shuffled everytime, reducing the chances of the same output as the last time, 
   making it seem more realistic and less repetitive.

3. Function "to_markdown" formats the generate response and makes it more presentable. The ipython's "Display" function converts the output generated by       
   "to_markdown" function and displays it as human readble text.
