1. Made the chatbot
   
2. Prevented errors from interrupting the program and handled it using exception handling. When the prompt is inappropriate, the bot throws a random reply from the list "error_responses",
   and asks the user to talk abouit something else. The list "error_responses" is also shuffled everytime, reducing the chances of the same output as the last time, making it seem more
   realistic and less repetitive.
   
3. Added a config list, specifiying a few parameters- "max_output_tokens", "temperature", "top_p", "top_k". Temperature(value: 0-1) controls how creative the bot's answers are going to be.
   The "max_output_tokens" controls the maximum number of words generate by the bot for a response.

4. Function "to_markdown" formats the generate response and makes it more presentable. The ipython's "Display" function converts the output generated by "to_markdown" function and displays
   it as human readble text.

//5. Added a list "convo_history" which will store the prompts of the user and pass the list to "model.generate_content" in it's history parameter so that the bot knows the context of the
   conversation and generates response accordingly.
